       " 'We’ve completely re-engineered the original, highest rated, best selling FretGuru file, resulting in an unbelievable performance improvement.. At the heart of the new file is FretGuru’s exclusive D.I.A. (Dual Integrated Arc) cutting geometry, which gives you far more precise CUTTING CONTROL, ACCURACY and FINISH than any other file - especially diamond files - GUARANTEED.. There\\'s an ideal-yet-elusive \"HOLY GRAIL\" for the way a fret crowning file SHOULD cut, where the file never touches the center line or \"peak\" of the fret top until the last few file strokes.. Especially true with freshly leveled frets, as you don\\'t want to disturb the perfectly level \"plane\" you\\'ve just created by removing material from the fret tops with a crowning file. Ideally you want to leave the finest sliver of leveled fret along the centerline, which is then polished.. Diamond files are often guilty of this - with the random way diamond grains are applied to the cutting groove, the stray grains often stick up higher than the surrounding grit.. How did we do it? I\\'ve wrestled 5 years with how to create this, with machinists and toolmakers just scratching their heads when I told them what I was trying to do.. The first problem with every other fret crowning file, they are all made using standard off-the-shelf tooling - typically ball end mills - which are only available in standard size increments, and MORE IMPORTANTLY, only available as a perfect sphere shape.. But one day the \"lightbulb\" went off, and I ran this idea by one of the top CNC toolmakers in the country.. He still didn\\'t think it would work, but reluctantly agreed to make a prototype tool... with no guarantee, that would cost more than 2 years supply of our normal tools.. The results? Mind-blowing, better than I could have ever imagined!. But don’t take my word for it, read the rave reviews from experienced world-class luthiers, AND absolute beginners. Then try it for yourself.',\n",

Proven, popular, excellent - New, improved and even better. Made in China. The item includes the OFC screw type cable.. From the Manufacturer. The AKG K 240 Studio is an update of the \"classic\" AKG K 240 Monitor. The new K 240 Studio delivers even wider dynamic range and higher sensitivity than its well-known and widely-used predecessor. The secret to the semi-open K 240 Studio\\'s sound quality is the new XXL transducers in acoustically tuned vented enclosures with circumaural (around the ear) pads. The circumaural pads envelope your ears nicely and reward you with smooth, solid bass and well-balanced, articulate mids and highs.. Founded in Vienna, Austria in 1947, AKG has built a legendary reputation in the professional audio industry for products that perform flawlessly. The reputation of AKG and its celebrated quality are built on more than 55 years of experience, incredible design, meticulous craftsmanship and a clear understanding of what truly sounds right. AKG introduced the K 140 in 1974 and the K 240 Monitor in 1975, which became the most widely used headphones in recording studios and broadcast facilities worldwide. Generations of musicians and audio engineers use these AKG products to create great mixes, hit songs and albums cherished by millions around the world. The new AKG Professional Studio headphones carry on the tradition of these audio tools and are a sound investment that will pay handsome returns with years of flawless sonic performance for professional recording engineers and demanding users of high quality home or portable audio equipment.. Delivers solid bass and well-balanced mids and highs. XXL Transducers with Varimotion Diaphragm. The new XXL transducers use AKG\\'s patented Varimotion diaphragm to ensure extremely accurate response at any listening level. This technology creates a diaphragm that is thinner, more elastic toward the outside edges for more powerful bass response and thicker, less resonant in the center for pure, accurate mids and clear, detailed highs. The large size of the transducers makes the overall sound more life-like and three-dimensional to capture the emotional and sonic content of your soundtracks.. Gimbal-Type Suspension. To ensure your listening comfort, AKG Professional Studio headphones utilize a self-adjusting headband with a flexible steel structure to deliver optimum fit for your headphones without any fiddling. The structure is flexible, yet strong enough to allow bending for single ear use and is durable enough to withstand rough handling. A gimbal-type suspension ensures the earcups of all AKG Professional Studio models will conform to the shape and size of your ears without pressing on them for hours of fatigue-free, comfortable listening.. Wear Them As You Like. Rugged construction, a non-twisting headband, and powerful sound allow you to use your headphones on a single ear only or wear them in any other way you may prefer. AKG Professional Studio headphones are ideal for DJ and live sound use because they are durable enough to withstand the roughest kind of handling during transport or on stage.. Detachable Cable with Mini XLR Connector. The new AKG Professional Studio headphones utilize a detachable input cable for easy replacement if ever necessary. The cable and headphones use mini XLR connectors for perfect contact and secure mechanical connection. The cable is made of 99.99% oxygen-free copper and has gold plated plugs on both ends including the screw-on 1/8\" to 1/4\" stereo jack adapter for maximum signal transfer.. Perfect for Portable Audio. You need good quality audio for all your listening--including computer, minidisc, portable CD or DAT player--as well as in the studio. Owing to their high sensitivity and wide dynamic range, the AKG Professional Series headphones are efficient enough to be used with these lower level output sources and still deliver the high definition sound you need when working in the studio or on stage. The excellent workmanship AKG headphones are known for and high quality components ensure loss-free transmission and reproduction of high-resolution signals from all types of digital audio sources.',\n",
